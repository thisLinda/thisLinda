### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Just completed Promineo Tech's front end bootcamp via Nashua Community College which enhanced my prior self-directed learning including Udacity/Google scholarship 2018. 
- ðŸŒ± There's a magnetic attraction between my inherent desire to create order from chaos and React's inherent foundation of "one function, one component."
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my undying devotion to animated slackmojis!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/linda-forlizzi
- âš¡ Fun fact: I bought my first computer in 1983, an Apple IIe. 
    Bummer fact: I didn't use it to learn programming.
